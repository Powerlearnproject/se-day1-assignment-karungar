# Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

## Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

### Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. It enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life such as communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.

### Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
* The development of programming languages:These were majorly hardware dependent high-level programming languages. The term software engineering had not yet been coined. The main purpose of any piece of software was to optimize exploitation of the limited hardware resources. Later evolving up to the first low-level Computer Aided Software Engineering tools (CASE tools) facilitating interactive editing, compiling, and debugging. 
* The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s:The aim was to reduce risk during development and improve quality and productivity. An important contribution of this stage was the formal modeling approach that enables implementation automation. There arose a need to focus on predesign phases and usage of more or less formal models for software specification. 
* The advent of structured programming in the 1970s:A number of structured methods, such as Software Requirement Engineering Methodology (SREM) and the Structured Analysis and Design Technique (SADT) were developed to allow the development of specification documents for business management software.

### List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning and Analysis: The development team collects requirements from several stakeholders such as customers, internal and external experts, and managers to create a software requirement specification document.This document sets expectations and defines common goals that aid in project planning. The team then estimates costs, creates a schedule, and has a detailed plan to achieve their goals.
2. Design: software engineers carry out analysis of the requirements and identify the best solutions to create the software.In this phase the development of a prototype modelis carried out.
3. Implementation: In the phase, the development team writes the code and builds the product. They analyze the requirements to identify smaller coding tasks they can do daily to achieve the final result.
4. Testing: The development team checks the software for bugs by combining automation and manual testing. Because many teams immediately test the code they write, the testing phase often runs parallel to the development phase.
5. Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers. Involves several tasks to move the latest build copy to the production environment, such as packaging, environment configuration, and installation..
6. Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.Involves fixing bugs, resolving customer issues, and managing software changes. 

### Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
* Agile projects are highly flexible, versatile, and adaptable wheras Waterfall methodology takes a highly structured and rigid approach.
* Waterfall methodology provides a clear path to project completion, making it easier to gauge success wheras Agile projects are extremely susceptible to scope creep as it is more open to ongoing collaboration and unexpected changes.
* Waterfall focuses on defining project budgets, timelines, requirements, and deliverables, making it a predictable methodology wheras Agile lacks this predictability could making it difficult to gain the approval of stakeholders before beginning a new project.
* Agile projects produce consistent deliverables over time, making it easier to detect and address issues before arriving at the final product whereas Waterfall projects usually donâ€™t realize their full value until the end of the project, which could result in sunk costs if you need to make changes or switch to a new project altogether.
  _Appropriate Scenarios for the two methodologies_
  #### Agile Methodologies| #### Waterfall Methodologies
  



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
